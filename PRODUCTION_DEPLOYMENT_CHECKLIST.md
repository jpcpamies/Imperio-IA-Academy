  GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE ai_academia_prod TO ai_academia_user;
  GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO ai_academia_user;
  GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO ai_academia_user;
"

psql -d ai_academia_prod -c "ALTER SYSTEM SET ssl = on;"
```

### 2. Environment Variables
```bash
# Production environment file
cat > .env.production << EOF
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://ai_academia_user:secure_password@localhost:5432/ai_academia_prod?sslmode=require

EOF
```

### 3. Database Migration
```bash
# Run migrations in production
encore db migrate --env=production
```

### 4. Application Deployment
```bash
# Build and deploy application
encore deploy --env=production

# Verify deployment
curl https://api.yourdomain.com/auth/health
```

## POST-DEPLOYMENT VALIDATION

### Functional Testing ✅
```bash
# Test user registration
curl -X POST https://api.yourdomain.com/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test User","email":"test@yourdomain.com","password":"TestPass123"}'

# Test user login
curl -X POST https://api.yourdomain.com/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@yourdomain.com","password":"TestPass123"}'

# Test password reset request
curl -X POST https://api.yourdomain.com/auth/request-password-reset \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@yourdomain.com"}'

# Test token verification
curl -X POST https://api.yourdomain.com/auth/verify-token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"token":"your-jwt-token"}'
```

### Security Testing ✅
```bash
# Test rate limiting (should fail after 5 attempts)
for i in {1..10}; do
  echo "Attempt $i:"
  curl -X POST https://api.yourdomain.com/auth/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"wrong@example.com","password":"wrong"}'
  echo ""
done

# Test CORS
curl -H "Origin: https://malicious-site.com" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type" \
  -X OPTIONS https://api.yourdomain.com/auth/login

# Test security headers
curl -I https://api.yourdomain.com/auth/health
```

### Performance Testing ✅
```bash
# Load test authentication endpoints
ab -n 1000 -c 10 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -p login_data.json https://api.yourdomain.com/auth/login

# Monitor response times
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s https://api.yourdomain.com/auth/health
```

### Monitoring Validation ✅
```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl https://api.yourdomain.com/auth/health | jq '.'

# Check security metrics
curl https://api.yourdomain.com/auth/security-metrics | jq '.'

# Verify logs are being generated
tail -f /var/log/app/auth.log
```

## ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

### Database Rollback
```bash
# Create backup before rollback
pg_dump -h hostname -U username -d ai_academia_prod > backup_before_rollback_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Restore from previous backup
psql -h hostname -U username -d ai_academia_prod < backup_previous_version.sql
```

### Application Rollback
```bash
# Rollback to previous version
encore deploy --env=production --version=previous

# Verify rollback
curl https://api.yourdomain.com/auth/health
```
